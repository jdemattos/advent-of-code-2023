# Advent of Code 2023
This is my [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) attempt using Rust. This is my first time using the Rust programming language.

I have several major goals with my AoC attempt this year:

- Write idiomatic Rust.
- Avoid use of third party dependencies.
- Use appropriate algorithms when applicable with a focus on minimizing time and space complexity.
- Write code that will be compatible with multiple CPU architectures without specialized instructions or techniques.

# Project Overview

I have organized the AoC puzzles into separate cargo projects organized by day to minimize compile times and binary sizes.

## Run application

```bash
cd ./day-1
cargo run
```

## Run unit tests

```bash
cd ./day-1
cargo test
```
